                    "Hello, my name is D.K Githinji. I am an engineering student based in Kenya, currently pursuing an undergraduate course in Electrical and Electronic Engineering. 
                    This journey has been not only exciting but also fulfilling. Every day, I wake up with a hungry mind for knowledge and exploration. 
                    One such path has led me into computers and programming. My interest in computers began during my childhood when I was introduced to those ancient (by now) phones with keypads and green screens. 
                    I always wondered how they worked, and my imagination did not stop at that. I remember playing "Space Invaders" and wishing I knew how to make one. 
                    Ten years later, I was writing my "Hello World!" program in Python on my cousin's laptop. This was after I completed my high school program and found myself with too much time to be idle. 
                    How I got there, I don't remember. Since then, I have worked on several hobby projects and continue to come up with more ideas. 
                    This has helped me develop my skills, and I am positive about my path and working towards my dreams."
