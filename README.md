flask web app for my portfolio

Introduction:
i built this web app using flask framework. Took me around two weeks to come up with an initial deployment. I like to work on my project locally then upload the whole bit after i fell that am almost done. feell like this helps me cut down some of my development time and work as well.

Key features:
The app has several pages, an index(base) tamplate, Landingpage, contacts, projects, and about page.It also has an admin page which alows me to add projects and delete them. I can also read received messages sent by visitors from the website.

-a blog page.
-a page for my art and graphics
